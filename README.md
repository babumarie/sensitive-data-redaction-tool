| Attacker | Exploit vulnerabilities | Red team simulation |
| Defender | Mitigate threats and secure systems | Blue team response |

## Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/babumarie/synthetic-dialogue-generator.git
cd synthetic-dialogue-generator

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (currently no external dependencies)

```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Dialogue Generation

```python
from src.synthetic_dialogue.dialogue_generator import DialogueGenerator

# Initialize generator
generator = DialogueGenerator()

# Define conversation sequence
role_sequence = ["Analyst", "Attacker", "Defender"]

# Generate structured dialogue
dialogue = generator.generate(role_sequence)

# Output structured conversation
for turn in dialogue:
    print(f"{turn['agent']} ({turn['role']}): {turn['message']}")
    print(f"Intent: {turn['intent']}\n")
```

### Custom Scenario Generation

```python
# Multi-turn security incident simulation
incident_roles = ["Analyst", "Analyst", "Attacker", "Defender", "Defender"]
incident_dialogue = generator.generate(incident_roles)

# Export for training data
import json
with open('security_dialogue.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(incident_dialogue, f, indent=2)
```
